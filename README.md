### Autonomous UI Testing & UX Repair Agent

Ghost in the Machine is an AI-powered quality assurance agent that **sees**, **reasons**, and **acts** on user interfaces like a human tester.

Instead of only scanning HTML or checking for broken links, the agent visually inspects a running application, executes real user journeys, detects usability problems, and proposes precise code fixes.

---

## 🚩 The Problem

Modern teams rarely have enough time or resources for deep end-to-end testing across:

- multiple devices  
- different screen sizes  
- complex navigation paths  

Traditional automation tools can verify functionality, but they cannot detect when something *feels wrong*, confusing, or visually broken.

---

## 💡 The Solution

Ghost in the Machine introduces an **autonomous UX auditor**.

It can:

✅ open a website  
✅ follow a goal (sign up, login, purchase)  
✅ observe outcomes  
✅ detect visual & flow issues  
✅ suggest exact implementation fixes

## 🧠 Key Capabilities

### Multimodal UI Understanding
Analyzes the rendered interface, not just the DOM.

### Agentic Task Execution
Plans and performs multi-step workflows, adapting if something fails.

### Automated Repair Suggestions
Generates minimal diffs in CSS / HTML / React to resolve detected problems.

### Transparent Reasoning
A live **Thinking Log** explains what the AI is observing and why it recommends changes.
